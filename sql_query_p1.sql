-- Data Analysis & Business Key Problems & Answers
-- The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

-- Q1 WAQ to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05' 
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

-- Q2 WAQ retrieve all transactions where the category is 'clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022
SELECT *

    AND sale_date >= '2022-11-01'
    AND sale_date <= '2022-11-30';
    
-- Q3 WAQ to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category
SELECT category, sum(total_sale) as net_sale, count(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

SELECT year, month, avg_sale 
FROM

RANK() OVER(partition by extract(year FROM sale_date) ORDER BY avg(total_sale) DESC) as rnk
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY year, month
) as t1
WHERE rnk = 1;

-- Q8 WAQ to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) as highest_sale
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY customer_id
